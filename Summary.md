## Flow
Main goal: explore the mountain safely.

1. Add traverse between turns
What: we need to practice traversing across the slope instead of sideslipping down the hill between turns.
Why: we can create a rounder turn shape.
How: when we finish the turn, we need to have some edge angle to keep our board moving across the slope.

2. Traverse with Flexion/Extension (+ at specific time) 滑的时候上下蹲起
What: now we try to add some up and down motion when traversing across the slope
Why: this can help us to feel the extension when we try to initiate the turn and feel the flexion after the fall line.
How: we bend our knees and ankles to get down, and then get up.

3. Novice Turns (flex after fall line)
What: A Novice Turn is similar to a Beginner Turn. The beginner turn is like double C in this way, but beginner turn required us to join the C together to become a S. 加上自己的手势动作进行解说
Why: we want to be more confident about the turn and enhance our stability/balance
How: we need to rotate our hips toward front foot to initiate beginner turn. When we approach the fall line, try to bend our hips, knees, and ankles to change to a new edge. Remember to traverse across the slope with edging to control the speed.

4. Speed = Shape + Size + Slope
If we want to decrease our speed, we need to increase the edge angle.
To reduce speed on steeper slopes, make rounder “closed” turns. 
To increase or maintain speed on flatter terrain, create larger, more “open” turns.

5. Sliding 360’s
What: rotate 360 degrees while sliding 
Why: This helps us to improve our edge control and balance skills. If we can do this well, we’ll prepare for more challenged and fun skills in the future.
How: you can do the clockwise and counter clockwise rotation as you want, no traversing and keep rotating. 
Feedback: don’t look at the snow and snowboard, just relax and look straight ahead.
