## Sliding
Main goal: we want to be comfortable standing on the snowboard while sliding with one foot attached.
以下基本上都是教练教一遍就记住了，解释what和how的时候直接做示范，why可以套上面的main goal, and get familiar with the neutral position。这一部分需要一直大声地给学生反馈，因为活动的范围不大，尽量让所有人都能听清楚你说话。Feedback话术：nice/beautiful turn! I like your neutral position! Look forward! 

1) “Push-Push-Glide” 
2) Straight Running 
3) Experiment With Varied Body Positions 加上游戏进行示范
4) Toe/Heel Drag 
5) J-Turns

## Basics
Main goal: we want to learn how to use the equipment, and be comfortable with moving around on the snowboard with one foot attached.

1. Introductions 
活跃气氛，不要冷场了
Introduce yourself, why do you want to take the CASI course

2. Equipment: Parts Of The Board 
介绍板的前后刃，介绍板头板尾巴，教学生区分左脚前右脚前
Two edges, nose and tail of the snowboard, goofy or regular? Put the foot that you use to kick the ball at the back of the snowboard.  

3. Attaching The Front Foot Equipment 
教学生安全穿板，使用binding
Clear the snow first, heel strap and toe strap, use the buckle to tie it up and release.

4. Familiarity & Mobility 
拉着学生动一动走一走

5. “The Neutral Position” 
很重要，贯穿整节课，建议自己总结一套关于这个的话术背下来，所以在这里我就不总结了

6. Skating Climbing & Descending
 这个就是穿着雪板带学生爬爬小坡，看一遍教练教就会了

## Control
Main goal: we need to learn to control the direction and speed with both feet attached to the snowboard. 主要强调控制身体从而对刃的控制

1. Intro to edging 刃
- What: Introduction to edging and speed control
- Why: we want to gain control over the snowboard
- How: while leaning, we try to flex/control our knees and ankles to decrease the edging angle to slide, and increase the edging angle to stop. 

2. One-Foot Attached Sideslipping & Drift Left / Right
- What: like its name
- Why: we want to be more confident on the snowboard and control the direction
- How: place the heel or toe slightly outside of snowboard to assist speed control. Now we can all sideslipping smoothly, which is good! So, we goanna learn how to drift left and right. With the neutral position, transfer a little bit pressure to my right foot, then we can drift across the slop to the right side.

3. One-Foot Attached Traverse
- What: like its name
- Why: we want to prepare for the future traversing when two feet attached and familiarize ourselves with its traversing path
- How: rotate the snowboard from heel side to toe side at the end of the drift.

4. Attaching The Board on A Slope
- What: like its name
- Why: its hard for beginners attach the board on a slope
- How: we use the heel edge of the snowboard, so we can “dig” a platform in the snow to avoid sliding down, and it’s easier for us to stand up. 教学生在坡上安全穿板

## Turn
Main goal: we goanna learn how to change the edges in the fall line

1. Static Rotation Exercise
- What: we do this on the flat terrain without snowboard
- Why: let us feel the movements required for turning
- How: imagine you are on the snow, rotate your hip like this. Also focus on the edging movement to bend your knees and ankles 

2. Garland Exercise / “Chicken Turns” two sides needed
- What: a practice 
- Why: let us familiarize with the initiation of the turn.
- How: traverse first, we start the turn by rotating our hip and body downhill slightly. As the snowboard gets the fall line, try to do rotation away from the fall line. If you feel the speed is high, try to increase the edge angle to slow down. 

3. J turns two sides needed
- What: a practice
- Why: let us familiarize with the completion of the turn.
- How: remember what we learned in the sliding, now wo want to do consecutive J turns like this. First, we follow the fall line to gain some speed, and then rotate your body to make a turn. There should be a board arc at the end of every J, so we can have edging and bend our knees and ankles.

4. Walking Through Turns
- What: we do this on the flat terrain without snowboard.
- Why: let us know the sequence of movements required for turning.
- How: walk on a S path

5. Beginner Turns 
- What: Turning the snowboard.
- Why: we want to move down the mountain using both edges and control the direction.
- How: On the toe side edge (facing uphill), we start to traverse across the slope and transfer a little bit pressure to the lead foot. Remember to look forward in the direction of travel. The we Initiate the turn by rotating with our lower body. When we approach the fall line, we slide on a flat base. Then we continue to pivot the snowboard by rotating and bending our knees and ankles to change from flat base to heel side.  (toe to heel)
说这些话的手都需要边做示范，加上body language



## Flow
Main goal: explore the mountain safely.

1. Add traverse between turns
- What: we need to practice traversing across the slope instead of sideslipping down the hill between turns.
- Why: we can create a rounder turn shape.
- How: when we finish the turn, we need to have some edge angle to keep our board moving across the slope.

2. Traverse with Flexion/Extension (+ at specific time) 滑的时候上下蹲起
- What: now we try to add some up and down motion when traversing across the slope
- Why: this can help us to feel the extension when we try to initiate the turn and feel the flexion after the fall line.
- How: we bend our knees and ankles to get down, and then get up.

3. Novice Turns (flex after fall line)
- What: A Novice Turn is similar to a Beginner Turn. The beginner turn is like double C in this way, but beginner turn required us to join the C together to become a S. 加上自己的手势动作进行解说
- Why: we want to be more confident about the turn and enhance our stability/balance
- How: we need to rotate our hips toward front foot to initiate beginner turn. When we approach the fall line, try to bend our hips, knees, and ankles to change to a new edge. Remember to traverse across the slope with edging to control the speed.

4. Speed = Shape + Size + Slope
- If we want to decrease our speed, we need to increase the edge angle.
- To reduce speed on steeper slopes, make rounder “closed” turns. 
- To increase or maintain speed on flatter terrain, create larger, more “open” turns.

5. Sliding 360’s
- What: rotate 360 degrees while sliding 
- Why: This helps us to improve our edge control and balance skills. If we can do this well, we’ll prepare for more challenged and fun skills in the future.
- How: you can do the clockwise and counter clockwise rotation as you want, no traversing and keep rotating. 
Feedback: don’t look at the snow and snowboard, just relax and look straight ahead.
